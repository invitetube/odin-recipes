    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cardamom</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>2 cups homemade pumpkin purée or 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 homemade pie crust, or 2 frozen premade pie shells</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the crust(s):</h3>
            <p>If using a homemade crust, line a deep-dish pie pan and put it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (1 or 2 hours is even better). If using store-bought frozen crusts, simply unwrap them just before using. You’ll need 2.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Preheat the oven:</h3>
            <p>Preheat your oven to 220°C. Position a rack in the bottom 1/3 of the oven.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Make the filling:</h3>
            <p>Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.</p>
            <p>Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed. The mixture will be runny but will set up in the oven.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Fill the pie shell and bake:</h3>
            <p>Pour the filling into 1 chilled homemade deep-dish pie crust or 2 premade frozen pie shells. Bake in the oven at a high temperature of 220°C for 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>After 30 minutes, lower the temperature to 180°C. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly. For 1 deep-dish pie, this will take one to two hours more. For 2 shallow pies, bake for 35 to 45 minutes more.</p>
            <p>About halfway through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges to keep the crust from getting too browned</p>
            <p>Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cool the pie on a rack, then serve:</h3>
            <p>Cool the pumpkin pie on a wire rack for 2 hours. Do not cut while still hot.</p>
            <p>Serve with whipped cream. You can also sprinkle some cinnamon/mixed spice on top.</p>
            <p>You can leave cooled pumpkin pie on the counter for up to 4 hours, then wrap it tightly and move it to the fridge for up to 3 days. If possible, let it come to room temperature before serving.</p>
            <p>For longer storage, tightly wrap individual slices or a whole, cooled pie and freeze for up to 1 month. Defrost overnight in the fridge and let come to room temperature before serving.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
